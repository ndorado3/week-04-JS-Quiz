# My Awsome JS Quiz 
This project is an assigned homework for the Georgia Tech coding Bootcamp. I created the HTL,CSS and Javascript code.

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct, this then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data.

## Code Critirias

1. By clicking the Start button the quiz begins and triggers the timer.
2. The first questions is display.
3. When the current question is answer it diplays the next question. 
4. When the user answered a question wrong the he/she is penalized by subtracting 10 seconds from the clock/timer.
5. The quiz is over, when all the questions are answered or the time reaches 0.
6. The user can save he/she initials and scores. 
7. The user can retake the quiz and clear the score history.
